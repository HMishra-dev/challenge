**Further improvements**

**In a production scenario, I would consider the following:**

1) Database Integration: Replace the in-memory data store with a persistent database.
2) Concurrency Testing: Perform extensive load and concurrency testing.
3) Input Validation: Add validation at the controller level to ensure correct data input.
4) Security: Implement security measures like authentication and authorization.
5) Logging and Monitoring: Enhance logging and integrate with a monitoring solution.
6) This implementation ensures that your transfer feature is thread-safe, adheres to business rules, and can be tested effectively.
